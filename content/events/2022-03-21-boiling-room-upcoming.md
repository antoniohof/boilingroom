Today we collect funds for the besieged city of Mariupol! The cooking and streaming starts at 18:15. We will have wonderful guests: @_perila playing music for us, as well as Eva and Serafima from @vitsche_berlin. They will talk about the initiatives their collective is involved in and their upcoming performance at @acudmachtneu on Thursday. The menu is delicious as always: borsch with crispy potatoes! Tune in and donate to: PayPal tu.mariupol@gmail.com or via our donation link (from which we will transfer to Mariupolâ€™s paypal).
