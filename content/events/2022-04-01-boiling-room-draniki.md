On Saturday 02.04. we will cook deruny-Ukrainian potatoe pancakes with sour cream and we’ll have two amazing guests: Gajek [@matti_gajek](https://www.instagram.com/matti_gajek/) providing the soundtrack and Blaise Baneh MBUH [@great_blaise_54](https://www.instagram.com/great_blaise_54/) speaking about his film documenting the work of Tubman Network [@portal.tubman.network](https://www.instagram.com/portal.tubman.network/) , raising awareness about racial profiling in the war in Ukraine. 

Also we are going to collect money for [@helping.to.leave](https://www.instagram.com/helping.to.leave/), an organisation that supports people who are in the process of leaving Ukraine, as well as those currently in the country and in need of help. Please donate to their [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/huiiivoiiine).

We can wait to meet our expanding community!
