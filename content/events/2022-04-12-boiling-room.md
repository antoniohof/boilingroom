After a fantastic time with the Brussels community, we’re ready to boil at Flutgraben this Sunday 24.04. with new energy. We connected with [@sonnenblau.ua](https://www.instagram.com/sonnenblau.ua/) an Ukrainian-Hawaiian-German family run collective who will tell as about their work as providers of medical supplies to Ukraine. Victoria, Kostja and Felita, the collective’s core team, proposed to very interesting dishes: halushki, that can be described as Ukrainian version of gnocchi and lomi tomato, a recipe from Hawaii.\
\
We’re also very excited to have [@juliia_jazz](https://www.instagram.com/juliia_jazz/) play for us. She is part of [@grvgrv.kyiv](https://www.instagram.com/grvgrv.kyiv/) , a super fun club collective from Kyiv.\

We’re looking forward to seeing our friends again and meet new participants that are coming to cook and to have a meal together!
