………………..

Boiling Room is a project that creates a shared space of collectivity through communal cooking. The project has been initiated to support people from and in war regions. During the cooking, we run a Live Stream with images from the kitchen, artistic intervention, interviews, and music. With our content, we aim to address relevant topics of current global conflict. The live stream serves us to raise donations for independent initiatives of people in Ukraine, working on the borders and all across Europe to help those in need. After every cooking session, we have a collective meal together with all participants. We see the cooking sessions as moment of collectivity where people who have arrived to Berlin from war regions can gather together with locals to exchange contacts and build relationships in a homely atmosphere.



Boiling Room is self-organised voluntary project that is run collectively by a group from various backgrounds and professions.

*We want to remind everyone that this project works with sensitive communities and that we kindly ask for all participants and visitors to avoid any sort of violent and disrespectful behavior and representation towards the members of our community.*
