Today we are going to cook a recipe that we got from a Ukrainian woman we met when we were serving the food: braised cabbage with mushrooms and potatoes. We will host a guest, Natalia Yeromenko @nata_yrmnk who is a Berlin-based Ukrainian facilitator, culture manager, and poet. She will share with us a poem that she wrote when the war just broke out and read some poems in Ukrainian. Incredible @finklubben Almaty will play for the cooks. Tune in and let's boil together!
