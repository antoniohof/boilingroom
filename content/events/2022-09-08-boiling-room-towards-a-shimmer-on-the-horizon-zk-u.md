We would like to invite everyone to join our chopping, peeling, dough rolling, boiling session to cook a traditional Eastern-European meal together (Vareniki & Kapusnyak) with our collective during the Towards the Shimmer of the Horizon event on 13.09. from 6pm, and to celebrate at the collective dinner of our own creation at 8:30.  It is a BYOK (Bring Your Own Knife) type of event. If you have any questions, please don’t hesitate to drop us a line at: boilingroom.info(at)gmail.com. We are excited to have [@allakrokha](https://www.instagram.com/allakrokha/) joining us for a soft sounds session dj-set as well as a live-act by [@sirakusy](https://www.instagram.com/sirakusy/). 

This time we join the initiative of Towards a Shimmer on the Horizon aims to explore steps, practices, thoughts and sounds that could shift consciousness towards post-capitalist desires, that may illuminate new structuring elements of society, that open up wishful imagination, that could give a glimpse of shimmering possibilities. The series is not about the distant utopia, but rather about exploring a next step towards a shimmer of a world that is not structured by extraction and power, from different positions, and acknowledging existing damage, precarity & complexity. (full concept here: [www.zku-berlin.org/timeline/towards-a-shimmer-on-the-horizon/](www.zku-berlin.org/timeline/towards-a-shimmer-on-the-horizon/))

A hands-on edition of Towards a Shimmer on the Horizon. Practicing repair, care, collectivity and cooking together, and looking towards structural change in everyday habits and practices of doing, being and relating. All participants today are invited to either join in the collective cooking or learn to upcycle and repair clothes - or also try out both. We will all share a meal afterwards, bringing the two practice groups together.

Platte - Love, Care and Repair Up Cycling Workshop

In a world of over-production and over-consumption repairing is already a political act that, at its own scale, stands against this system. In the upcycling process, creations are redesigned from existing materials without generating any further waste. Used textiles are upgraded or repurposed, leftovers from industrial overproduction and discarded fabrics and cuts from the previous season are used for new designs. During the Platte Love, Care and Repair Up Cycling Workshop, you can bring clothes you want to repair and the Platte team will help you to fix them with different creative techniques.
