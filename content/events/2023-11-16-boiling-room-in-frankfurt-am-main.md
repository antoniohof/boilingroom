Join us on Saturday the 18th of November for the next BoilingRoom session in Frankfurt am Main - 17:00 - 21:00 at Freitagsküche in Frankfurt (Mainzer Landstraße 105). The collective cooking will be interwoven with soft music, conversation with guest speakers and an open mic before the meal. The event will bring together multiple voices, communities and age groups (kids are also welcome). This session is organised in collaboration with the new art program Art as Social Practice / HfMDK Frankfurt.

BoilingRoom is a space for people who are in contact with war, and we understand that traumatic experiences and strong emotions can sometimes lead to heated expressions.\
As a space that encourages all voices to speak and be heard, we ask everyone to respect each other‘s grief and experiences and hold space for the other.
