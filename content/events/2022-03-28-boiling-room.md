Today we are going to make a more elaborate dish: banush and potatoes vinegrette. The music will be provided by Gleb Kovalski aka Dosaaf @kvlski, a Belarusian artist and performer based Kyiv and Berlin. Banush is is a dish prepared from cornmeal with added smetana (cream), with various toppings. It is popular in the Carpathian region.

We would also like to propose a new fundraiser and we hope the Boiling Room audience can generously donate. Our friends in Kyiv working with territorial defense are fundraising for this really expensive drone with thermovision. It costs 5400EUR and they are still missing 700EUR. Letâ€™s help them!
