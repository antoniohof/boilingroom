title: Boiling Room Livestream â€“ cooking for people escaping the war
---
Boiling Room is a multidisciplinary volunteer initiative to provide warm meals for people escaping the war. 
It is a livestream cooking show where musicians, artists, cooks and poets come together to cook and deliver the warm meals to train stations, shelters and registration centers. 

Join the livestream with cooking, artistic interventions, poetry, interviews and music and let us know if you would like to volunteer or participate in the artistic programm. 
The livestream will serve as a way to generate donations to buy groceries and the future development of the project. The excess would be forwarded to various independent initiatives of people fighting in Ukraine, working on the borders and all across Europe to help those in need. 

We see the current global situation as a moment that asks for radical solidarity and collective care for each other.
